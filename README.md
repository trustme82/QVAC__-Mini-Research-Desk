# QVAC Mini Research Desk



## Overview

Install the JS/TS or Python clients in your project. Then, load models and use them to perform AI inference locally.

The SDK has two layers:

* **Worker** — the runtime that actually runs the models. Today the worker ships as the `@qvac/sdk` npm package.
* **Clients** — per-language APIs that drive the worker. Two clients ship today: JS/TS (`@qvac/sdk` on npm) and Python (`tetherto-qvac-sdk` on PyPI). Same worker, same generated contract, same capabilities.

Pick the client that matches your stack:

  ## Releases

  - [Latest version: v0.7.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qvac/sdk)
  - [Release notes for this version](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-sdk/releases/tag/v0.5.0)
  */}

## Description

The SDK is cross-platform, type-safe, and pluggable, exposing all QVAC capabilities through a unified interface.

### Key features

* **Cross-platform:** portable code across Linux, macOS, and Windows (JS/TS on Node.js / [Bare runtime](https://bare.pears.com), Python on CPython); Android and iOS via [Expo](https://expo.dev) (TS only).
* **Pluggable**: build lean apps by including only what you need, and extend the SDK with custom plugins.
* **Type-safe:** typed APIs in both JavaScript and Python (Pydantic models generated from the same contract).
* **Unified interface:** multiple AI tasks, one client package per language.

* [**Assess model fit:**](/models/assess-model-fit) check whether a model is likely to fit in memory before downloading it.

## Flow

Before you can use a model, you need to load it from some location into memory. The flow for performing AI inference is:

1. Load one model into the SDK. You can load multiple models simultaneously by repeating the call.
2. Perform AI tasks by calling the appropriate SDK functions — e.g., a completion.
3. When you are done with a model, unload it to release computer resources.
4. Finally, close the SDK instance.

The concrete API names differ by client — in JS/TS it is `loadModel()` / `completion()` / `unloadModel()` / `close()` (see [API reference](/reference/api)); in Python it is `load_model` / `completion` / `unload_model` and the `Client()` context manager (see [Python SDK](/python-sdk)).

## Models

Each [AI task](#ai-tasks) works with different model families, and among the supported ones, you can choose which to use and how to obtain them. Model loading manages the download and caching of models (one or multiple files), and their loading from disk into memory, preparing them for use.

Models can be loaded from three different locations:

* Local filesystem, by providing a path
* HTTP server, by providing an HTTP URL
* Our distributed model registry

SDK packages do not ship with built-in models, **but** their APIs expose constants representing preconfigured models (e.g., `LLAMA_3_2_1B_INST_Q4_0`). Each constant maps a model already published to our model registry. When loading a model, you can provide one of these constants instead of a location, making model retrieval transparent.

For more on querying the model registry, see [`modelRegistryList()`](/reference/api#modelregistrylist), [`modelRegistrySearch()`](/reference/api#modelregistrysearch), and [`modelRegistryGetModel()`](/reference/api#modelregistrygetmodel) (JS/TS), or `model_registry_list` / `_search` / `_get_model` (Python — see [Python SDK — Running examples](/python-sdk#running-examples) for a runnable script).

For more on loading models in JS/TS, see [`loadModel()` at `@qvac/sdk` API reference](/reference/api#loadmodel).
